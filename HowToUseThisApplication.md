1. When you first see the screen you might want to add some tasks to your tasks list and it might look something like this:

4.  You can use the CLEAR button to clear the schedule and generate another schedule if you dont think the previous schedule suits your time and needs.

    NOTE: Tasks that are completed wont be taken into consideration while generating the schedule. So once you complete a task, you can create a schedule to complete the rest of your tasks on time:
